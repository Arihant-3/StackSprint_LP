# **StackSprint_LP**

### *Stack Sprint Learning Path - API, JSON & Real-World Integrations*

🚀 **StackSprint_LP** is a structured **20-day learning journey** where I built practical skills in **APIs, JSON, Streamlit, BigQuery, and FastAPI** - through daily tasks, focused lessons, mini-projects, and a final capstone.

This repository documents the **entire journey**, including code, notebooks, and projects that progressively build towards real-world API-driven applications.

## **📅 Learning Path Overview**

- **Duration:** 20 Days (1 hour/day)
- **Pace:** Beginner-friendly -> Career-relevant
- **Focus Areas:**
    1. API Fundamentals & JSON Handling
    2. Advanced API Features (Auth, OAuth 2.0, Pagination, Rate Limits)
    3. Data Integration (SQL, Pandas, BigQuery)
    4. Visualization (Power BI, Streamlit)
    5. Web Framework Basics (FastAPI)
    6. Mini & Final Projects

## **💡 Highlights**

- **Hands-On Daily Tasks** : Every concept paired with real API calls and data handling.
- **Mini Projects** : Weather App, Holiday Info App, Weather & Mood App.
- **Capstone Project** : *News Summarizer via News API + NLP*.
- **Tools Covered** : `requests`, `pandas`, `Streamlit`, `FastAPI`, `BigQuery`, SQL integration.
- **Best Practices** : `.env` for API keys, `.gitignore` for secrets, modular code.

## **⚙️ Installation**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arihant-3/StackSprint_LP.git
cd StackSprint_LP
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

---

## **▶️ Usage**

1. Create a `.env` file with your API keys.
2. Open the desired notebook in Jupyter or VS Code.
3. For Streamlit/FastAPI apps:
```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    
```

## **📌 Key Takeaways**

This journey helped me:

- Understand APIs beyond just GET & POST.
- Work with authentication, headers, rate limits, and real-time APIs.
- Integrate APIs into dashboards, web apps, and automation workflows.
- Build a project from **idea : working product**.
